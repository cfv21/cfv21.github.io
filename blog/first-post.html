        <h1>looking forward</h1>
        <p>in five weeks, i'll graduate from florida state university with a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.</p>

        <p>it’s a moment i’ve worked toward for years — and like a lot of people in tech, it’s only the beginning. over the last few summers, i’ve been fortunate enough to gain hands-on experience in two very different (but equally technical) internships.</p>

        <p>at kingsway community in schenectady, ny, i worked as an it intern, helping monitor, troubleshoot, and improve a real-world network environment. from deploying wireless access points to using tcpdump to debug network issues, it was all about keeping the system running smoothly — and learning a ton in the process.</p>

        <p>before that, i spent two summers as a data analyst intern at araya, where i built automated systems to manage file transfers, emails, and storage for thousands of data files. i enjoyed digging into powerShell, SQL, and JSON workflows — but more than anything, i liked the challenge of making something work more efficiently than before.</p>

        <p>those experiences made one thing clear: i like solving problems, especially when it involves code, large datasets, and a bit of creative thinking.</p>

        <p>my background in math has always pushed me to think critically — to break problems down and rebuild them better. computer science gave that mindset a toolkit. python is my favorite language, but i’m always exploring. whether it's software engineering, data analysis, or something in between, i'm excited to keep building things that are useful and thoughtful.</p>

        <p>this site is one of those things. maybe it’s simple right now — but like everything else, it’s only the start.</p>
